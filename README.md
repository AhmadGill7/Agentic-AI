# Agentic AI - Learning Journey

A comprehensive repository documenting my day-by-day journey in learning and building Agentic AI systems. This repository serves as a structured record of projects, experiments, and implementations as I progress through various concepts and technologies in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Agentic AI.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is organized chronologically, with each day's work contained in its own dedicated folder. Each day focuses on specific concepts, tools, or implementations related to Agentic AI, providing both learning materials and working code examples.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```text
Agentic-AI/
├── Day 1 - [Topic]/
│   ├── AGI-Day-1/          # Day 1 project implementation
│   └── README.md           # Day 1 documentation
├── Day 2 - [Topic]/        # Future days will be added here
└── README.md               # This file
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this journey, I aim to:

- **Understand Core Concepts**: Deep dive into the fundamentals of Agentic AI and AGI
- **Hands-On Implementation**: Build practical projects and tools
- **Best Practices**: Learn and apply industry-standard development practices
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for future reference
- **Continuous Learning**: Track progress and iterate on previous learnings

## 📖 How to Navigate

Each day's folder contains:

- **Project Code**: Working implementations and examples
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation for that day's work
- **Dependencies**: Required packages and setup instructions
- **Usage Examples**: How to run and use the projects

To explore a specific day's work:

1. Navigate to the corresponding day folder (e.g., `Day 1 - UV/`)
2. Read the day-specific README for detailed information
3. Follow the setup and usage instructions provided

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmadGill7/Agentic-AI.git
   cd Agentic-AI
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific day**:

   ```bash
   cd "Day 1 - UV"
   ```

3. **Follow the day-specific README** for setup and usage instructions

## 📅 Progress Tracker

| Day    | Topic                       | Status         | Description                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1  | UV/OpenAI Responses API CLI | ✅ Complete    | Interactive CLI tool with conversation memory |
| Day 2+ | TBD                         | 🔄 In Progress | Future learning days will be documented here  |

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

This repository will explore various technologies including (but not limited to):

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **UV** - Fast Python package manager
- **OpenAI API** - AI model integration
- **Various AI/ML Frameworks** - As the journey progresses
- **Development Tools** - Best practices and workflows

## 📝 Notes

- Each day's work is self-contained and can be explored independently
- Projects may build upon previous days' learnings
- Documentation is maintained for educational and reference purposes
- Code examples are production-ready where applicable

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal learning journey repository. However, suggestions, feedback, and discussions are welcome through issues and pull requests.
